# `0x07 - Python-Test-driven-development`
This is a deep delve into the world of deploying test_cases before the actual implementation of code in the modules, program or packages.  
A good practice that makes use of the doctest inbuild test framework embedded with the python interpretor by default.  
Unittests are also another option to use that makes use of the object orientation method of development.  
The motive of this case is to ensure we handle most of the possible error cases that emerge during software development process  
Test files will be stored seperately so as to import the modules explicitly for testing
